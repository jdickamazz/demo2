            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/shourovj/Autonomous-Inventory-Robot" target="_blank">Autonomous Inventory Robot</a> - In this project, we developed an Inventory Bot which can take real-time voice commands and bring the object mentioned in the voice command using real-time object detection by YOLOv, then grabbing the object with necessary ARM movement and bringing it back to the base with LFR.
            </li>

                <a href="https://github.com/shourovj/Deep-Learning-based-Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-VGGIN-Network" target="_blank">Deep-Learning-based Breast Cancer Classification Using VGGIN</a> - In this project, I trained the VGGIN model on the BreakHis histopathology dataset and achieved 99.628% accuracy on the test dataset. VGGIN is a deep learning model combining VGG-19 and the Inception module.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/shourovj/Voice-Controlled-Smart-Wheel-Chair-for-Disabled-Patient" target="_blank">Voice Controlled Wheelchair for Disabled Patients</a> - We developed a method to control a wheelchair with only the patient's voice commands. Our wheelchair takes voice commands from the patients in any language and in any accent and moves accordingly. [Video]

            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/shourovj/Electrical-Fault-Classification-with-GAF-image" target="_blank">Machine Learning Based Electrical Fault Classification with GAF Image</a> - ML algorithms like Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, and CNN-based deep learning methods were used to classify the electrical fault from the BUS voltage and current data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/shourovj/DSP-Project-materials" target="_blank">Extracting Audio from Muted Video</a> - The main objective of this project was to extract the audio signal from a muted video using signal processing methods in MATLAB. This was originally a project by Abe Davis, MIT [Visual Microphone].
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/shourovj/Vehicle-Tracking-and-Theft-Detection-and-Prevention" target="_blank">Car Theft Detection and Prevention with Automatic GPS Tracking</a> - This is an IoT-based project. GSM and GPS technology were used to track and send the car location, and the ESP32-CAM module was used to capture the photo of the thief and shut the car down. [Video Presentation]
